`Twitter integration for iOS` is a demo iOS application writter in Objective-C demonstrating how to integrate Twitter API for iOS into iPhone application. 

For more information please check out the video tutorial on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jLfxcSnfrP8&t=5s)

In this demo project we have covered following three Twitter APIs,
1. Authenticate user using their Twitter account
2. Compose Tweet from the app and post it on Twitter timeline
3. Use REST API to fetch tweets from user's timeline and show in the app in TableView format.

## Usage
* `Property List.plist` file has twitter consumer-key and consumer-secret-key. Replace the values with the ones Twitter created for your application.

* `Info.plist` file has URL Scheme for Twitter call-back Url that contains value `twitterkit-<consumerKey>`. Replace `<consumerKey>` with your application's consumer key.
